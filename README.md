# Dinheirus.Cash

Cancer is the leading cause of death among children and adolescents in Brazil. Did you know that worldwide, nearly 30 million new cases of cancer are expected in 2040? It would be an increase of approximately 47% compared to 2020. 

We want to be part of the solution, so our first mission is to support the Cancer Foundation no Brazil.

At the same time we have a second equally important mission, to make Dinheirus Cash an adoptable currency.

We will develop an ecosystem where Dinheirus.cash can be used as a means of payment, later we will work for it to be used outside of our ecosystem as well.

We are a token designed on the Binance Smart Chain network.

Dinheirus.Cash was launched on July 2, 2021. Our project has a wallet of donations to the Cancer Foundation (https://www.cancer.org.br/), a large and reputable institution for the study and fight against cancer in Brazil.

Our token is deflationary, so every transaction suffers a burn rate and another generation of coin holders.
